## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
After creating the multiple linear regression model on the data, I converted the AWD variable to a factor instead of an integer. This is the summary of the model with all 5 predictor variables.

The variables that are significant (alpha = 0.10) in predicting the mpg value are vehicle length, vehicle weight, and ground clearance. The slope of the linear model is non-zero, meaning that the variables just listed provide a way to get a better prediction than a linear model with a slope of zero. This linear model (with all 5 predictors) predicts mpg relatively effectively. It's adjusted R-squared value is 0.6825, meaning that about 68% of the variance in mpg is explanined by the 5 variables in the full model.
